# Embedded-Systems-Last-Project

For project 6, I used the IR distance sensor to control the pitch of a tone emitted by the speaker. For project 8, I again used this sensor, only this time I graphically displayed the last 15 values read by the sensor using the OLED. This is more complicated than the previous project because I had to learn how to draw stuff on the OLED, and then more specifically how to draw a graphical representation of this data. I also had to figure out how to store these values in a queue structure, which I implemented using an array.
